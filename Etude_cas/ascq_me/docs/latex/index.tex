This software is a computer program whose purpose is to identify proteins by peptide mass fingerprinting. Its scoring is based on spectral correlation between an experimental MS spectrum and theoretical MS spectra. The experimental spectrum is a mass spectrum without mono isotopic mass extraction. Theoretical spectra are generated from proteins in FASTA format thanks to an algorithm based on Fast Fourier Transform.
